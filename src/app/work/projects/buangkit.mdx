## Overview

**BuangKit** stands for *Buang, Uang, Bangkit* (Throw, Money, Rise). It is a GUI app that encourages urban residents to dispose of their waste properly by rewarding them with points that can be exchanged for digital credit, electricity tokens, or cash.

The app connects users to nearby waste banks and helps solve real environmental challenges through daily actions.

## Why This Matters

Waste is one of the most pressing problems in urban environments. Improper waste handling causes:

- Environmental pollution  
- Health risks to communities  
- Economic losses due to unmanaged waste systems  

At the same time, many households are not engaged with waste banks or proper sorting practices. BuangKit changes that by turning **trash into motivation**.

## How It Works

BuangKit users can:

- Register and log in to track their waste transactions  
- See a detailed history of waste drop-offs (type, location, weight, time)  
- Deliver trash to the nearest waste bank  
- Earn reward points  
- Redeem those points for useful digital benefits (phone credit, electricity, e-wallet)

    {
      code:
`1. Log in or register as a new user
2. Check the nearest waste bank
3. Drop off sorted household trash
4. Earn and track reward points
5. Redeem rewards through the app`,

## Real Impact

BuangKit aims to:

- Educate citizens on sorting and valuing household waste  
- Empower users with financial incentives to act sustainably  
- Reduce unmanaged waste in cities  
- Support and digitize local waste bank networks  

This model offers a **win-win** for both citizens and the environment.

## Key Features

<Table 
  data={{
    headers: [
      { content: "Feature", key: "feature" },
      { content: "Description", key: "description" }
    ],
    rows: [
      ["Login/Register", "Secure access with user profile and history tracking"],
      ["Waste History", "Detailed record of all past submissions"],
      ["Rewards", "Earn points for each drop-off at verified waste banks"],
      ["Point Exchange", "Convert points into credit, electricity, or e-wallet balance"]
    ]
  }}
/>

## Technical Implementation (OOP Concepts)

The app is built using Java and JavaFX, applying object-oriented programming principles:

- **Abstraction**: Interface methods for initializing UI
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with getters/setters in models
- **Inheritance**: Page classes inherit common UI logic
- **Polymorphism**: Overridden methods for custom behaviors
- **Reusability**: Subclasses for shared layouts and navigation`,
