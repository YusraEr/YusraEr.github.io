## Why EventHub?

Managing events involves multiple challenges: creating events, tracking ticket availability, managing attendees, and processing payments. EventHub offers:

- Centralized control for admins and organizers
- Real-time ticket tracking
- Easy ticket booking for attendees
- Secure and scalable Laravel-based architecture

With a full feature set and modern UI, EventHub is ideal for managing anything from small workshops to large conferences.

## How It Works

1. Admins manage users, events, and view reports
2. Organizers create and track their own events
3. Attendees browse, book, and review events
4. Ticket availability updates in real time
5. Payments and bookings processed securely
