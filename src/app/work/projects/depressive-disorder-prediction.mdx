## Project Overview

Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders, yet many people do not receive early diagnosis or support. In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict a person’s risk of having depression, based on real-world health survey data.

The goal is to help identify people who may be at risk, using factors like stress, loneliness, physical health, and lifestyle—so that preventive actions can be taken earlier.

## Data Source

The model is trained on data from the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)**, a large-scale public health survey conducted in the United States.

The dataset includes information from thousands of adults, covering:

<Table 
  data={{
    headers: [
      { content: "Category", key: "category", sortable: true },
      { content: "Examples", key: "examples" }
    ],
    rows: [
      ["Demographics", "Age, Gender, Race, Education, Income"],
      ["Health", "Diabetes, Asthma, Arthritis, BMI"],
      ["Lifestyle", "Physical activity, Smoking, Alcohol use"],
      ["Social factors", "Stress, Loneliness, Emotional support, Life satisfaction"]
    ]
  }}
/>
The target variable is whether a person reported having been diagnosed with depression.

## How the Model Works

To predict depression risk, I used several machine learning methods that are good at handling complex, real-life data:

- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Histogram Gradient Boosting (HGB)**

Because the number of people with and without depression in the data was imbalanced, I used a technique called **SMOTE** to balance it. I also fine-tuned the models using **Bayesian Optimization** to improve accuracy.

To explain how the model makes decisions, I used a tool called **SHAP**, which shows how much each feature (like stress or gender) contributes to the prediction.

## Results

The best-performing model was the **Histogram Gradient Boosting** with tuning. It achieved:

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`Accuracy:   74%
Precision:  67%
Recall:     73%
F1-Score:   68%
ROC AUC:    81%`,
    language: "text",
    label: "Model Performance"
  }
]} />

These results show that the model is fairly accurate in identifying individuals who may be at risk of depression.

## What Factors Matter Most?

By analyzing the model, we found that these are the most important factors linked to depression:

- **Stress frequency** — How often a person feels stressed  
- **Gender** — With women showing higher risk  
- **Loneliness** — Feeling isolated or unsupported  
- **Age group** — Young adults and middle-aged groups have higher rates  
- **Race/Ethnicity** — Some groups are more affected than others  

These findings are consistent with mental health research and highlight the need for social and emotional support.

## Why This Matters?

This model can help:

- Screen for depression risk without invasive tests  
- Guide health programs to target those who need help most  
- Support doctors and counselors with data-driven insights  
- Raise awareness about how daily life affects mental health  

## Limitations

- The data is self-reported, so it may contain some bias  
- The model is based on U.S. data—it should be tested on other populations  
- It does not include clinical or genetic information  

## What’s Next

In the future, this project can be expanded by:

- Connecting with real-time data (e.g., wearables or electronic medical records)  
- Exploring deep learning models for more complex analysis  
- Adapting the model for use in other countries, including Indonesia
